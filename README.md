## HTML

The link (Search Engine Optimization) wasn't working, on HTML code was missing the ID attribute.

I have created only one class selector (container1) for the 3 divs inside the div (content).

## CSS

I have written some comments and made the code a little bit clean.  

I have created 1 class: container1 and that sets the characteristcs of the divs inside the div (content)and it helped to clean the css code.

## Github

1. I have created a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to my computer.
